By finding out structural similarity of the images helped me in finding the difference or similarity in the shape of the images. Similarly, finding out the threshold and contours based on those threshold for the images converted into grayscale binary also helped me in shape analysis and recognition.
As, My SSIM is ~31.2% I can say that the image user provided is fake or tampered.
Finally I visualized the differences and similarities between the images using by displaying the images with contours, difference and threshold.
